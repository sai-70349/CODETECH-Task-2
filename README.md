## Project Overview: Digital Lock System

### Objective

The primary objective of the Digital Lock System is to provide a secure mechanism that allows access based on a predefined code. The system utilizes a Finite State Machine (FSM) to manage states related to locking and unlocking, ensuring that unauthorized access is prevented while allowing legitimate users to gain entry.

### Key Activities

- **State Machine Design:** Implement a FSM to manage the different states (Idle, Wait for Code, Unlocked, and Locked).
- **Input Handling:** Develop logic to handle user inputs for code entry and the "enter" button.
- **Output Control:** Generate outputs indicating the lock status (locked/unlocked) based on the state of the FSM.
- **Simulation and Testing:** Create a testbench to simulate various scenarios and verify the systemâ€™s functionality.

  
### Technologies Used

- **Hardware Description Language (HDL):** Verilog for designing the digital lock system and its testbench.
- **Simulation Tools:** Use tools like ModelSim, Icarus Verilog, or Vivado to simulate the design and verify its correctness.
- **Waveform Viewer:** GTKWave or similar tools to visualize the VCD output and analyze the state transitions and outputs.

  
### Future Scope

- **Enhanced Security:** Implement multi-factor authentication by adding features such as biometric input (fingerprint or facial recognition).
User Management: Develop a system to manage multiple user codes with varying access levels.
- **Remote Access:** Integrate wireless communication for remote locking and unlocking capabilities via mobile devices.
- **Alert System:** Add functionality to trigger alerts (like sirens) upon unauthorized access attempts.
  
### Deliverables

- **Verilog Code:** Complete implementation of the Digital Lock System and its testbench.
- **VCD File:** Generated VCD file containing waveform data for the simulation.
- **Documentation:** A detailed report outlining design specifications, state diagrams, test cases, and simulation results.
